## Math Aptitude Analyzer

### Description 
The Math Aptitude Analyzer is an interactive C++ console application designed to assess and enhance a user’s math skills. The program collects information about the user’s study habits and confidence level, calculates an estimated problem-solving rate, and saves the results to a formatted file. It also includes a 5-question math quiz with instant feedback and a student report card builder for teachers, demonstrating key C++ concepts such as loops, selection statements, switch-case logic, file handling, and modular functions.

### Features
1) Welcomes the user with a friendly, colorful banner
2) Collects User Input:
   * Full name
   * Favorite math subject
   * Number of math problems solved per week
   * Confidence level in math (1–10 scale)
   * Hours spent studying math per week
3) Performs calculations to estimate problems solved per hour
4) Validates input to handle invalid entries gracefully
5) Outputs results to a neatly formatted file ('report.txt')
6) Switch Case Demonstration – Performs a simple math operation (+, -, *, /, %) between two randomly generated integers provided by the program and the operator entered by the user.
7) 5-Question Math Quiz – Uses a for loop to evaluate the user’s basic math skills and provides tailored feedback based on performance and confidence level.
8) Simple Student Report Card Builder – Uses a do...while loop to allow teachers to input multiple students’ data, including grade and test score, and automatically generates feedback saved into a file (StudentsReportCard.txt).
9) Demonstrates usage of selection statements (if/else and switch case), loops (for, while, do...while), and file handling (writing data to text files).
10) Use Value Returning and Void Functions to break the programs in smaller part to complete each tasks. All the functions calls are made in main.cpp
 
### How to Run the Program
1) Open your Visual Studio or VS Code on your computer
2) Make sure to have a C++ Compiler installed on your computer
3) Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory
4) Compile/Run the program
5) If you enter invalid data type for integer or double type, then you will see a default value for that variable. You can re-run/restart the program to enter correct data types for each variable.
6) The program will also demonstrate loops and file writing functionality by saving outputs in report.txt and StudentsReportCard.txt.
